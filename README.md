# -Productivity-Prediction-of-Garment-Employees



  The garment industry deals with the production of different types of clothing. It is a trillion-dollar industry on the global scale (reference), and is a labor- and capital-intensive industry. Workforce productivity in general refers to a measurement of goods and/or services produced by a group of workers within a given time period. High productivity levels by a team translate to higher profits, and are an indication of efficient use of the inputs in the production process. Worker productivity in the garment industry should therefore be maximized as it is a key factor to its success.


Low workforce productivity in a company can lead to reduced profitability, increased conflict, high employee turnover, and a lack of motivation. It is therefore important for a company to track its levels of productivity and investigate the factors that influence this.
